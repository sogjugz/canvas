## Note
Forked from https://github.com/cnvs/canvas with a few modifications for specific purpose.

## Introduction

Canvas is a fully open source package to extend your existing [Laravel](https://laravel.com) application and get you up-and-running with a blog in 
just a few minutes. In addition to a distraction-free writing experience, you can view monthly trends on your content, get insights into reader traffic and more!

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.2
- Laravel >= 6.0
- One of the [four supported databases](https://laravel.com/docs/master/database#introduction) by Laravel

## Installation

> **Note:** Canvas requires you to have user authentication in place prior to installation. Please see the [official guide](https://laravel.com/docs/master/authentication#introduction) to get started.   

You may use composer to install Canvas into your Laravel project:

```bash
composer require cnvs/canvas
```

Publish the assets and primary configuration file using the `canvas:install` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan canvas:install
```

Create a symbolic link to ensure file uploads are publicly accessible from the web using the `storage:link` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

## Configuration

After publishing Canvas's assets, a primary configuration file will be located at `config/canvas.php`. This file allows you to customize various aspects of how your application uses the package.

Canvas exposes its UI at `/canvas` by default. This can be changed by updating the `path` option:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Base Route
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This is the URI path where Canvas will be accessible from. You are free
| to change this path to anything you like. Note that the URI will not
| affect the paths of its internal API that aren't exposed to users.
|
*/

'path' => env('CANVAS_PATH_NAME', 'canvas'),
```

If your application has a custom User model, define the fully-qualified path in the `user` option:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| User Model
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Next, you may define a specific user model that your application will
| use for authentication. This will define the relationships between
| a user and their posts, tags, and topics that they author.
|
*/

'user' => Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User::class,
```

Sometimes, you may want to apply role or permission-based access to Canvas. You can create and attach any additional middleware here:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Route Middleware
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| These middleware will be attached to every route in Canvas, giving you
| the chance to add your own middleware to this list or change any of
| the existing middleware. Or, you can simply stick with the list.
|
*/

'middleware' => [
    'web',
    'auth',
],
```

Canvas uses the storage disk for media uploads. You may configure the different filesystem options here:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Storage
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This is the storage disk Canvas will use to put file uploads. You may
| use any of the disks defined in the config/filesystems.php file and
| you may also change the maximum upload size from its 3MB default.
|
*/

'storage_disk' => env('CANVAS_STORAGE_DISK', 'local'),

'storage_path' => env('CANVAS_STORAGE_PATH', 'public/canvas'),

'upload_filesize' => env('CANVAS_UPLOAD_FILESIZE', 3145728),
```

## Available Options

> **Note:** The following features are completely optional, you are not required to use them.

### Frontend

While Canvas does not dictate a specific design for your frontend, it does provide a basic starting point using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) that will be helpful for many applications. The scaffolding is located in the `cnvs/studio` Composer package, which may be installed using Composer:

```bash
composer require cnvs/studio
```

Once the `cnvs/studio` package has been installed, you may install the frontend scaffolding using the `studio:install` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan studio:install
```

After installing the `cnvs/studio` Composer package and generating the frontend scaffolding, your `package.json` file will include the necessary dependencies to install and compile:

```bash
# Using NPM
npm install
npm run dev

# Using Yarn
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Unsplash

**Want access to the entire [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) library?** Set up a new application at [https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications), grab your access key, and update `config/canvas.php`:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Unsplash Integration
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Visit https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications to create a new Unsplash
| app. Use the confidential Access Key given to you to integrate with
| the API. Note that demo apps are limited to 50 requests per hour.
|
*/

'unsplash' => [
    'access_key' => env('CANVAS_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY'),
]
```

### Weekly Digest

**Want a weekly summary?** Canvas allows users to receive a weekly summary of their authored content. Once your application is [configured for sending mail](https://laravel.com/docs/master/mail), update `config/canvas.php`:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| E-Mail Notifications
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This option controls e-mail notifications that will be sent via the
| default application mail driver. A default option is provided to
| support the notification system as an opt-in feature.
|
|
*/

'mail' => [
    'enabled' => env('CANVAS_MAIL_ENABLED', false),
]
```

Since the weekly digest runs on [Laravel's Scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling), you'll need to add the following cron entry to your server:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Updates

Canvas loosely follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and increments versions as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` numbers
- A major or minor version _can contain breaking changes_, so follow the [upgrade guide](.github/UPGRADE.md) for a step-by-step breakdown
- Patch versions will remain backwards compatible, so you can safely update the package by following the steps below:

You may update your Canvas installation using composer:

```bash
composer update
```

Run any new migrations using the `migrate` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Re-publish the assets using the `canvas:publish` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan canvas:publish
```

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Canvas! You can use the [contribution guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to assist you in setting up the package for development.

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
composer test
```

## Translate

One of the goals for the team behind Canvas is to ensure proper localization across the app. If you come across any translation mistakes or issues and want to make a contribution, please [create a pull request](https://github.com/cnvs/canvas/pulls). If you don't see your native language included in the `resources/lang` directory, feel free to add it.
